It's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by. But in the long run. There's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder. Your head is humming and it won't go. In case you don't know. The piper's calling you to join him. Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow. And did you know. Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. And as we wind on down the road. Our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know. Who shines white light and wants to show. How everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard. The tune will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all. To be a rock and not to roll. And she's buying the stairway to heaven.
