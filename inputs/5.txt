There's a lady who's sure. All that glitters is gold. And she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there she knows. If the stores are all closed. With a word she can get what she came for. Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven. There's a sign on the wall. But she wants to be sure. 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook. There's a songbird who sings. Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving. Ooh, it makes me wonder. Ooh, it makes me wonder. There's a feeling I get. When I look to the west. And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen. Rings of smoke through the trees. And the voices of those who standing looking. Ooh, it makes me wonder. Ooh, it really makes me wonder. And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune. Then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn. For those who stand long. And the forests will echo with laughter. If there's a bustle in your hedgerow. Don't be alarmed now.
